### HW6 - Chess Browser

With a provided GUI, we used C# to implement the database queries that allow a user to upload PGN files to
the database and then browse those games using various filters.

Goals:
- practice and/or de-rust C# skills
- gain experience incorporating SQL in a programming language to dynamically generate database queries
- pracice avoiding SQL injection attacks using prepared statements

### HW7 - Library Web Server

With a provided web application, we used C# to scaffold the library database. We then create queries using LINQ
to implement the controller that generates the JSON code to display.

Goals:
- practice scaffolding model code from an existing database
- query the model using LINQ
- produce a standard JSON representation of the model for display by a web server
